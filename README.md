# scorebridge-ts-submodule

place to put common ts code among scorebridge repos without overhead of npm package

Unfortunately at time of writing [AWS Amplify frontend hosting does not support cloning private submodules](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-hosting/issues/2904#issuecomment-1806651395).

However, On 2023-11-30 I converted this repo to public w/MIT license; perhaps now AWS Amplify FE hosting will work again.  TODO: try it.

Ideally it would be an npm package.  Punting on that for now.
